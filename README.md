  -data.txt are out values for Z1 of the lifetime experiment
  -data2.txt are the values for Z2
  -data3.txt are the values for Z12 of the angle experiment.
To determining the lifetime of a muon use lebensdauer.py with lebensdauerData.txt
To determine the angular distribution use WinkelVerteilung.py and WinkelData.txt
To determine the Spektrum of muons use spektrum.py and a102_results.txt meta data can be found in a102_results.mcd
